<h1>Moises Lopez</h1>
<p>I am Moises Lopez, a student in Cerritos College. I am presently working on getting a certificate in coding. I have a passion for computers (although I am not very good at them) and have for a long time the desire of learning to code. This seems to be the time to do it since I am changing carrers, or at least building my skills for another options on the job market.I had a intro course on HTML many, many years ago. I am hoping that some of that is still in my head.</p>
<br />
<p>These are thre things that I really llike doing:</p>
<ol>    
    <li>Reading good books. Books on any topic</li>    
    <li>Playing Nintendo with my daughters</li>    
    <li>Learning about the universe</li> 
</ol>
<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> because whenever I need to learn about something quick, that is the place </p>
